  "original_question": "The electronics category accounts for 7.2% of top product categories and has an average purchase amount of $280.12. If a customer purchased $257.43 worth of hotels online, which is 0.5% of total electronics sales, what percentage of this customer's purchase was dedicated to the electronics category?",
  "original_answer": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the situation**\nWe have a customer who purchased $257.43 worth of hotels online, which is 0.5% of total electronics sales. We need to find out what percentage of this customer's purchase was dedicated to the electronics category.\n\n**Step 2: Find the total electronics sales**\nFrom the given data, we know that the average purchase amount in the electronics category is $280.12 and the total electronics sales are unknown. Let's assume the total electronics sales is X.\n\nWe can set up an equation using the percentage of top product categories:\n7.2% of total purchases = $280.12 (average purchase amount)\nX = $280.12 / 0.072\nX \u2248 $3888.33\n\nSo, the total electronics sales are approximately $3888.33.\n\n**Step 3: Find the hotels sales as a percentage of total electronics sales**\nWe know that the customer purchased $257.43 worth of hotels online, which is 0.5% of total electronics sales.\n$257.43 = 0.005 \u00d7 X\nSubstituting X \u2248 $3888.33:\n$257.43 = 0.005 \u00d7 3888.33\n$257.43 = 19.44\n\nSo, the hotels sales are approximately 19.44% of total electronics sales.\n\n**Step 4: Find the percentage of this customer's purchase dedicated to electronics**\nWe know that the customer purchased $257.43 worth of hotels online, and we want to find out what percentage of this amount was dedicated to the electronics category.\nLet's assume the amount spent on electronics is Y.\n\nWe can set up an equation using the given information:\n$257.43 = 0.5% \u00d7 X + Y\n\nSubstituting X \u2248 $3888.33 and simplifying:\n$257.43 = 19.44 + Y\nY \u2248 $237.99\n\nSo, the amount spent on electronics is approximately $237.99.\n\n**Step 5: Find the percentage of this customer's purchase dedicated to electronics**\nNow that we know the amount spent on electronics (Y), we can find the percentage:\n(237.99 / 257.43) \u00d7 100% \u2248 92.44%\n\nTherefore, approximately **92.44%** of this customer's purchase was dedicated to the electronics category.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 92.44%. I hope it is correct.",

  "formatted_answer": "**\n\nfirst, i'll find the total electronics sales.\ntotal electronics sales = $280.12 / 0.072 = <<$280.12/0.072=$3888.33>>$3888.33\n\nnext, i'll find the hotels sales as a percentage of total electronics sales.\nhotels sales = $257.43 / x = <<$257.43/x=19.44>>19.44%\n\nnow, i'll find the amount spent on electronics.\nlet y be the amount spent on electronics.\n$257.43 = 0.005 \u00d7 x + y\nsubstituting x \u2248 $3888.33:\n$257.43 = 0.005 \u00d7 3888.33 + y\n$257.43 = 19.44 + y\n\nsimplifying:\ny \u2248 $237.99\n\nfinally, i'll find the percentage of this customer's purchase dedicated to electronics.\npercentage = (237.99 / 257.43) \u00d7 100% \u2248 <<(237.99/257.43)*100%=92.44>>92.44%\n\n#### 92.44"
