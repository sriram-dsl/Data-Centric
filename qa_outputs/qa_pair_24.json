We know that 49.2% of customers in this segment are loyalty program members, and there are a total of 242 customers in this segment.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the number of loyalty program members\n\nNumber of loyalty program members = 0.492 * 242 = 119.41 (round down to 119)\n\nStep 2: Find the revenue generated by these loyalty program members' purchases\n\nRevenue from loyalty program members = Average purchase amount per order * Number of orders\n= $276.54 * Number of orders\nWe don't know the number of orders, but we can find it using the total purchase amount and average purchase amount.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total purchase amount for this segment\n\nTotal purchase amount for this segment = Total customers in this segment * Average purchase amount per customer\n= 242 * $276.54\n= $66921.63\n\nStep 4: Calculate the number of orders using the total purchase amount and average purchase amount\n\nNumber of orders = Total purchase amount / Average purchase amount per order\n= $66921.63 / $276.54\n= 243 (round up to 244)\n\nStep 5: Calculate the revenue generated by these loyalty program members' purchases\n\nRevenue from loyalty program members = Average purchase amount per order * Number of orders\n= $276.54 * 244\n= $67445.36",
