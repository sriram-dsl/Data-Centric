  "original_answer": "I'm ready to solve the word problem. Since there are no specific instructions or numerical values provided in the prompt, I'll assume that the task is to analyze the customer data and provide insights or calculate some relevant metrics.\n\nLet's start by identifying the categories of interest:\n\n* Animal Feed\n* Groceries\n* Sports & Outdoors\n* Food & Beverages\n\nWe can group these categories into two broad categories: Pet-related products (Animal Feed) and Non-pet related products (Groceries, Sports & Outdoors, and Food & Beverages).\n\nNext, let's focus on the demographic characteristics of customers who purchased pet-related products:\n\n1. Age: 25 (Row 887), unknown for other rows\n2. Gender: Female (Row 887), unknown for other rows\n3. Income Level: Middle\n4. Marital Status: Widowed (Row 887), unknown for other rows\n5. Education: Bachelor's\n6. Occupation Level: Middle\n7. Location: Esp\u00edrito Santo do Pinhal (Row 887), unknown for other rows\n\nWe can also analyze the purchase frequency, channel, and date to identify trends or patterns.\n\nFinally, let's look at some shopping behavior metrics:\n\n1. Brand Loyalty: Varies between customers\n2. Product Rating: Varies between customers\n3. Research Time: Varies between customers\n4. Social Media Influence: High (Row 918), unknown for other rows\n5. Discount Sensitivity: Somewhat Sensitive (Row 887) and Not Sensitive (Row 918)\n6. Return Rate: Varies between customers\n7. Satisfaction: Varies between customers\n\nNow that we've analyzed the customer data, let's try to answer some questions:\n\n* What is the average purchase amount for pet-related products?\n* Which demographic characteristics are most common among customers who purchased non-pet related products?\n* Are there any trends or patterns in the purchase frequency, channel, and date?\n\nTo provide a more comprehensive solution, I'll need additional information or specific instructions. If you could provide more context or clarify what you'd like me to calculate or analyze, I'd be happy to help!",

Among these customers, 50% were female, and among the females, 40% used social media to make their purchase. How many male customers purchased pet-related products?\n\n**",
  "formatted_answer": "**\n\nAnalyze demographic characteristics of customers who purchased pet-related products:\n\nPet-related customers = 240\n\nFemale pet-related customers = 0.5 \u00d7 240 = <<0.5*240=120>>120\n\nMale pet-related customers = 240 - 120 = <<240-120=120>>120\n\n#### 120"
