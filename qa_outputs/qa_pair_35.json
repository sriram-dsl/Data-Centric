  "original_question": "The \"Social Media Influence: High\" segment has a loyalty program membership rate of 43.7%. If there are 268 customers in this segment, and the average order value for non-members is $284.30, how much more revenue does the store generate from loyalty members compared to non-members if each customer makes exactly one order?",
  "original_answer": "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the number of loyalty members**\nThe \"Social Media Influence: High\" segment has a loyalty program membership rate of 43.7%. If there are 268 customers in this segment, we can calculate the number of loyalty members as follows:\n\nNumber of loyalty members = Total customers in segment \u00d7 Loyalty program membership rate\n= 268 \u00d7 0.437\n= 117.3 (round to nearest integer)\nLet's assume there are approximately 117 loyalty members.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate revenue from non-members**\nThe average order value for non-members is $284.30, and each customer makes exactly one order. To find the total revenue from non-members, we multiply the number of non-members by their average order value:\n\nNumber of non-members = Total customers in segment - Number of loyalty members\n= 268 - 117\n= 151\n\nRevenue from non-members = Number of non-members \u00d7 Average order value\n= 151 \u00d7 $284.30\n= $42,461.30\n\n**Step 3: Calculate revenue from loyalty members**\nThe average order value for loyalty members is the same as for non-members ($284.30). We can calculate the total revenue from loyalty members by multiplying their number by their average order value:\n\nRevenue from loyalty members = Number of loyalty members \u00d7 Average order value\n= 117 \u00d7 $284.30\n= $33,443.10\n\n**Step 4: Find the difference in revenue**\nTo find out how much more revenue the store generates from loyalty members compared to non-members, we subtract the revenue from non-members from the revenue from loyalty members:\n\nDifference in revenue = Revenue from loyalty members - Revenue from non-members\n= $33,443.10 - $42,461.30\n= -$9,018.20\n\nThe store generates approximately $9,018.20 less revenue from loyalty members compared to non-members.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe final answer is:\n\n-$9,018.20",
