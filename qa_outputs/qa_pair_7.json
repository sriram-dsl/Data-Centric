Here's my solution:\n\nStep 1: Identify the relevant information\nThe problem asks for the total revenue generated from purchases made using smartphones among True discount usage customers. The relevant information is that the smartphone device usage rate is 30.9% for True discount usage customers, and the average purchase amount for this segment is $273.99.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of customers who used smartphones\nThe problem states that the total customers in this segment (True discount usage) are 521. The smartphone device usage rate among these customers is 30.9%. To calculate the number of customers who used smartphones, I will multiply the total number of customers by the device usage rate:\n\nNumber of smartphone users = 521 * 0.309 = 161.49\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a customer, I'll round down to the nearest whole number:\n\nNumber of smartphone users \u2248 161\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total revenue generated from purchases made using smartphones\nThe problem states that the average purchase amount for True discount usage customers who used smartphones is $273.99.
