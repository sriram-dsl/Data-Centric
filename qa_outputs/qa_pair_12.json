  "original_question": "Among Agender customers who shop in-store, the average purchase amount is $235.57 and the total purchase amount is $2120.17. If there are 9 such customers, what is the percentage discount rate used by these customers?",
  "original_answer": "To solve this problem, I will follow the instructions provided. Here's my step-by-step solution:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question**\nThe question asks for the percentage discount rate used by Agender customers who shop in-store. We are given the average purchase amount and total purchase amount of these customers.\n\n**Step 2: Identify relevant information**\nFrom the Multi-Dimension Segment Analysis: Gender: Agender + Discount Usage: False, we know that there are 9 such customers with an average purchase amount of $235.57 and a total purchase amount of $2120.17.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of purchases**\nWe can calculate the total number of purchases by dividing the total purchase amount by the average purchase amount:\n\nTotal number of purchases = Total purchase amount / Average purchase amount\n= $2120.17 / $235.57\n= 9 (since we are given that there are 9 such customers)\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the discount rate**\nSince there is no discount usage in this segment, the total purchase amount is equal to the sum of individual purchases at full price. Let's call the full price \"P\". Then:\n\nTotal purchase amount = P * Total number of purchases\n$2120.17 = P * 9\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the full price**\nSolve for P:\n\nP = $2120.17 / 9\n= $235.57 (since we are given that this is the average purchase amount)\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the percentage discount rate**\nThe percentage discount rate can be calculated as follows:\n\nDiscount rate = (Full price - Actual price) / Full price * 100\n= ($235.57 - $235.57) / $235.57 * 100\n= 0%\n\nTherefore, the percentage discount rate used by these customers is **0%**.",
