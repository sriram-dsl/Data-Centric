  "original_answer": "I'd be happy to help you with the word problem. Here's my step-by-step solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the average satisfaction rating for customers who purchased hotels**\nFrom the Segment Analysis: Product Category: Hotels table, we can see that the average customer satisfaction is 5.8/10.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the percentage increase in satisfaction compared to the average**\nThe problem states that this customer's satisfaction rating was higher than the average satisfaction rating for customers who purchased hotels (5.2/10). We are asked to find the percentage increase in satisfaction.\n\nLet's calculate the difference between the two satisfaction ratings:\n\nDifference = 7/10 - 5.8/10 = 0.2/10\n\nTo find the percentage increase, we can use the formula:\n\nPercentage Increase = (Difference / Average) * 100\n= (0.2/10) * 100\n= 2%\n\nTherefore, this customer experienced a **2%** increase in satisfaction compared to the average.\n\nAnswer: 2",
