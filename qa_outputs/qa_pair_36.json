  "original_answer": "I'd be happy to help solve this word problem. Here's my step-by-step solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the given information**\nWe know that the \"Social Media Influence: Medium\" segment has an average purchase amount of $280.12, and 34.7% of customers make their purchases online. We also know there are 236 customers in this segment.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of online customers**\nTo find the number of online customers, we multiply the total number of customers (236) by the percentage of customers who made their purchases online (34.7%).\n\nOnline customers = 236 * 0.347 = 81.51\n\nWe'll round this value down to 81 since you can't have a fraction of a customer.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from online purchases**\nNow that we know the number of online customers, we can multiply it by the average purchase amount ($280.12) to find the total revenue from online purchases.\n\nTotal revenue = 81 * $280.12 = $22,649.92\n\nSo, the total revenue generated from online purchases is $22,649.92.",
