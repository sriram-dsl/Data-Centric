  "original_question": "The online segment of a company has an average purchase amount of $213.62 and a total purchase amount of $854.48. If this segment is comprised of 4 customers, what is the percentage increase in average customer satisfaction if the customers in this segment have an overall satisfaction score of 7.2/10?",
  "original_answer": "To solve this problem, I will start by identifying the average purchase amount and overall satisfaction score for each segment. Then, I will calculate the percentage increase in average customer satisfaction.\n\nStep 1: Identify the average purchase amount and overall satisfaction score for each segment.\nFrom the given data, we can see that the online segment has an average purchase amount of $213.62 and a total purchase amount of $854.48 with 4 customers. The overall satisfaction score is 7.2/10.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the percentage increase in average customer satisfaction.\nTo calculate the percentage increase, we need to find the difference between the new satisfaction score (7.2/10) and the previous satisfaction score (5.5/10). Then, we will multiply this difference by 100 and divide it by the original satisfaction score.\n\nDifference = New satisfaction score - Previous satisfaction score\n= 7.2/10 - 5.5/10\n= 1.7/10\n\nPercentage increase = (Difference / Original satisfaction score) * 100\n= (1.7/10 / 5.5/10) * 100\n= 30.91%\n\nTherefore, the percentage increase in average customer satisfaction is approximately 30.91%.",
