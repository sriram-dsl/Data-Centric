If this category accounts for 6.4% of total sales from customers with high income levels and the overall average order value is $267.77, what percentage of total sales comes from this category among all customers?",
  "original_answer": "To solve this problem, I'll follow the instructions and break it down into step-by-step reasoning. Here's my solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify relevant information**\nFrom the given data, I notice that customers with high income levels (4.1%) tend to spend more on products in the Sports & Outdoors category, with an average order value of $283.10. This category accounts for 6.4% of total sales from customers with high income levels. Additionally, the overall average order value is $267.77.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from customers with high income levels**\nTo find the total revenue, I'll multiply the number of customers (21) by the average purchase amount ($283.10):\n\nTotal revenue = 21 * $283.10 = $5945.05\n\n**Step 3: Find the percentage of total sales that comes from Sports & Outdoors among customers with high income levels**\nI'll divide the total revenue from this category (6.4% of $5945.05) by the overall average order value:\n\nPercentage of total sales = ($5945.05 * 0.064) / $267.77 \u2248 2.27%\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the percentage of total sales that comes from Sports & Outdoors among all customers**\nTo find this percentage, I'll divide the percentage of high-income customers (2.1%) by the overall average order value:\n\nPercentage of total sales = 0.021 / $267.77 \u2248 0.008\n\n**Step 5: Convert the result to a decimal and multiply it by 100 to get the final answer**\nI'll multiply the decimal result by 100 to convert it to a percentage:\n\nFinal answer = 0.008 * 100 \u2248 0.8%\n\nSo, approximately **0.8%** of total sales comes from the Sports & Outdoors category among all customers.\n\nAnswer: 0.8",

  "formatted_answer": "**\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the total revenue from customers with high income levels.\nTotal revenue = 21 * $283.10 = <<21*283.10=5945.05>>5945.05\n\nNext, I'll find the percentage of total sales that comes from Sports & Outdoors among customers with high income levels.\nPercentage of total sales = ($5945.05 * 0.064) / $267.77 = <<5945.05*0.064/267.77=2.27>>\u2248 2.27%\n\nNow, I'll calculate the percentage of total sales that comes from Sports & Outdoors among all customers.\nPercentage of total sales = 2.1% * (1 / $267.77) = <<2.1%/267.77=0.008>>\u2248 0.8%\n\n#### 0.8"
